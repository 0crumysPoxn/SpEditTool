Trivial Pursuit is one of the most popular and beloved board games of all time. It was created in 1979 by two Canadian journalists, Chris Haney and Scott Abbott, who wanted to create a game that would test their general knowledge. They came up with the idea of a game that would have six categories of questions: Geography, Entertainment, History, Arts & Literature, Science & Nature, and Sports & Leisure. Each category would have a corresponding color and a wedge-shaped piece that players would collect by answering questions correctly.
