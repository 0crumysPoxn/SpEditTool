Microsoft Songsmith is a software that lets you create your own songs by singing into your computer's microphone. It automatically generates a musical accompaniment that matches your voice and style. You can choose from different genres, such as pop, rock, jazz, or reggae, and adjust the mood and tempo of your song. You can also customize your music by changing the chords, instruments, or style. You can then share your songs with your friends and family, post them online, or make your own music videos.

Microsoft Songsmith was developed by a team at Microsoft Research, led by researchers Dan Morris and Sumit Basu. It was launched in early 2009 as a commercial product for Windows users. It is based on a research project called MySong, which was conducted in collaboration with a University of Washington student, Ian Simon, in 2007. The software uses machine learning and signal processing techniques to analyze your voice and generate music that fits your melody and preferences.
 
Microsoft Songsmith is a fun and easy way to express your creativity and musical talent. It can also be used as a learning tool for music theory and composition. You can experiment with different musical elements and see how they affect your song. You can also edit the chords directly or play your own instrument instead of singing. If you are a teacher, you can use Songsmith for free in your classroom to teach music concepts and inspire your students.
