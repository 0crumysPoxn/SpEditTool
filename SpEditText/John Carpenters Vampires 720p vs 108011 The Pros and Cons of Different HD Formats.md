## What is 720p and 108011?
 
720p and 108011 are two types of video resolutions, which refer to the number of pixels or dots that make up the image on the screen. The higher the resolution, the more detail and clarity the image has.
 
720p stands for 720 pixels high and progressive scan, which means that each frame of the video is displayed in full. 108011 stands for 1080 pixels high and interlaced scan, which means that each frame of the video is split into two fields that alternate on the screen.
 
## What are the advantages and disadvantages of each resolution?
 
Both resolutions have their pros and cons, depending on your preferences and devices. Here are some of them:
 
- **720p**: This resolution is more compatible with older devices and slower internet connections. It also consumes less bandwidth and storage space. However, it has less detail and sharpness than 108011, especially on larger screens.
- **108011**: This resolution is more suitable for newer devices and faster internet connections. It also offers more detail and sharpness than 720p, especially on smaller screens. However, it requires more bandwidth and storage space. It also might have some flickering or blurring effects due to the interlaced scan.

## Which one should you watch?
 
The answer depends on your personal preference and situation. If you have a smaller screen, a faster internet connection and a higher tolerance for flickering or blurring, you might prefer 108011. If you have a larger screen, a slower internet connection and a lower tolerance for flickering or blurring, you might prefer 720p.
