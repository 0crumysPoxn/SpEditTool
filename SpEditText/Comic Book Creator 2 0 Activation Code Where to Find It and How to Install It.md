Pixton is a fun and easy way to create your own comics online. It is suitable for anyone who loves comics, regardless of their age or skill level. You can use it for personal or educational purposes, or even for professional projects. Pixton is a great tool to express yourself and tell stories in a visual way.

Pixton has received positive reviews from many users, especially teachers and students who use it for educational purposes. According to Common Sense Education, Pixton is a popular comics platform that centers students' creativity and helps them build art skills, stretch their creative muscles, and think critically about sequencing, context, and story structure[^3^]. Pixton also offers a huge searchable library of lesson ideas sorted by grade level, objective, and subject[^3^]. Many teachers have praised Pixton for engaging their students and making them enjoy the writing process[^4^].
 
However, Pixton also has some limitations and drawbacks. One of them is that it does not allow users to draw their own characters or backgrounds, which can be frustrating for those who want more artistic freedom. Another one is that it does not have a direct communication or feedback feature for teachers and students. Teachers have to use other tools or platforms to assign tasks, monitor progress, and provide feedback to their students[^3^]. Moreover, some of the templates and content packs can lack nuance or accuracy, and may require additional instruction or clarification from teachers[^3^].
 
Pixton is a very basic comic maker, ideal for children to try and create their own basic comic strips. It is easy to use and has loads of pre-made art and poses. It is also fairly cheap, with different plans and prices for individual users, educators, and businesses[^2^]. However, it is not suitable for anyone who wants to create more complex or original comics. Pixton is a fun and simple way to make comics online, but it is not a professional tool for comic artists.
