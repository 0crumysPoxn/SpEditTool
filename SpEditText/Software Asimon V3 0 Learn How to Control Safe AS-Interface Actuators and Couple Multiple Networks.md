# How to Configure AS-Interface Safety Monitor with Software Asimon V3.0
 
AS-Interface (AS-i) is a simple and flexible communication system for connecting sensors and actuators to a higher-level controller. AS-i also supports safety-related applications with AS-i Safety at Work (ASIsafe), which allows the transmission of safety signals over the same cable as standard signals.

ASIsafe requires a safety monitor, which is a device that evaluates the safety signals and switches off the outputs in case of an emergency. The safety monitor can be configured with a software tool called ASIMON V3.0, which is available from different manufacturers such as ifm[^1^], Siemens[^2^] and Pepperl+Fuchs[^3^].
 
In this article, we will show you how to use ASIMON V3.0 to configure an AS-i safety monitor in a few steps.
 
## Step 1: Install ASIMON V3.0 on your PC
 
To install ASIMON V3.0 on your PC, you need to have a CD-ROM or download the software from the manufacturer's website. The software is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 (32/64 bit); 10 Pro, 10 Enterpr. (64 bit); Win Server 2012, 2016 (64 bit).[^2^]

Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your PC after the installation.
 
## Step 2: Connect your PC to the AS-i safety monitor
 
To connect your PC to the AS-i safety monitor, you need an interface adapter that converts the USB or RS232 port of your PC to the AS-i port of the safety monitor. The interface adapter also provides power supply for the safety monitor.
 
Plug one end of the interface adapter into your PC and the other end into the AS-i port of the safety monitor. Make sure that the power LED on the interface adapter is on.
 
## Step 3: Launch ASIMON V3.0 and select your safety monitor
 
Launch ASIMON V3.0 from your desktop or start menu. The software will automatically detect the connected safety monitor and display its name and version on the screen.
 
If you have more than one safety monitor connected to your PC, you can select the one you want to configure from the drop-down menu.
 
## Step 4: Create a new project or open an existing one
 
To start configuring your safety monitor, you need to create a new project or open an existing one. A project contains all the settings and parameters of your safety application.
 
To create a new project, click on File > New Project and enter a name for your project. To open an existing project, click on File > Open Project and browse to the location of your project file.
 
## Step 5: Define your safety devices and logic
 
The next step is to define your safety devices and logic. A safety device is any sensor or actuator that has a safety function, such as an emergency stop button, a light curtain or a door switch. A safety logic is a set of rules that determines how the safety devices interact with each other and with the outputs.
 
To define your safety devices and logic, you need to use the graphical flow chart editor in ASIMON V3.0. The flow chart editor allows you to drag and drop different elements such as inputs, outputs, operators and timers onto a grid and connect them with wires.
 
You can also use predefined building blocks that contain common safety functions such as two-hand control, muting or interlocking. You can also create your own custom building blocks and save them for future use.
 
## Step 6: Test and download your configuration
 
The final step is to test and download your configuration to the safety monitor. To test your configuration, you can use the simulation mode in ASIMON V3.0. The simulation mode allows you to activate or deactivate different inputs and observe how they affect the outputs and the status of the safety monitor.
