- A computer with Windows XP or later operating system
- The customer programming software (CPS) for your radio model

## Where to Get the Software
 
You can download the CPS for your radio model from the official Motorola website[^1^]. The CPS is a complementary download for programming and provisioning business radios. You will need to register and log in to access the download page. The CPS is compatible with CLS series, CLP Series, Curve, DLR series, DTR series, RDX series and RM series radios.
 
If you cannot find the CPS for your radio model on the Motorola website, you can try searching for it on other websites that offer Motorola radio software for free[^2^]. However, be careful when downloading software from unverified sources, as they may contain viruses or malware. You should also check the compatibility of the software with your radio model before using it.
 
## How to Connect Your Radio to Your Computer
 
Once you have downloaded and installed the CPS on your computer, you will need to connect your radio to your computer using the programming cable. The programming cable is a device that connects your radio's accessory port to your computer's serial or USB port. You can buy a programming cable from Motorola or other online retailers, or you can make one yourself if you have the skills and materials[^2^].
