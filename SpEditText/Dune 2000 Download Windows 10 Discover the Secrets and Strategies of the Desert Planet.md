The gameplay of Dune 2000 is similar to other classic RTS games of the era, such as Command and Conquer or Warcraft. You need to build a base, harvest spice as your main resource, train units, research upgrades, and attack your enemies. You also need to deal with environmental hazards, such as sandworms that can devour your units or vehicles, or dust storms that can damage your buildings. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique units and superweapons. For example, the Atreides have fast and agile units, such as ornithopters and sonic tanks, and can call for air strikes. The Harkonnen have powerful and durable units, such as devastators and missile tanks, and can launch a devastating death hand missile. The Ordos have stealthy and unconventional units, such as saboteurs and deviators, and can use a projector to create fake units.
 
Dune 2000 also features a rich story that is based on the Dune novels and movies. The game has full-motion video cutscenes that show the events of the war between the three houses for the control of Arrakis. The cutscenes are well-acted and have a cinematic quality that adds to the immersion of the game. The game also has a great soundtrack that captures the mood and atmosphere of the Dune universe. The music is composed by Frank Klepacki, who also worked on other Westwood games such as Command and Conquer and Blade Runner.
