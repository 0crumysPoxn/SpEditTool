The Fairchild 670 compressor was renowned for its advanced compression techniques and incomparable sound. It could smooth out transients, enhance dynamics, glue tracks together and add a rich harmonic saturation. However, the original hardware unit was very rare and expensive, and only a few studios had access to it.
 
Fortunately, Waves has teamed up with Grammy-winning producer and engineer Jack Joseph Puig to capture every distinctive nuance of his Fairchild 670 along with every detail of its rich analog sound. The Waves Puigchild 670 plugin is a stereo version of the Fairchild compressor that offers two modes: Lat/Vert and M/S.
 
The Lat/Vert mode allows you to adjust the left and right channels independently or together, while the M/S mode lets you control the mid and side signals separately or in combination. This gives you more flexibility and creative options for shaping your stereo image and enhancing your mix.
 
The Waves Puigchild 670 plugin also features a sidechain filter, a mix knob for parallel compression, a noise control for adding or removing analog noise, and a headroom control for adjusting the input level. You can use it on individual tracks, buses or the master channel to add some vintage vibe and magic to your sound.
 
To download the Waves Puigchild 670 plugin, you need to visit the Waves website and purchase it for $29.99 (limited time offer). You will also need a Waves account and an iLok account to activate and use the plugin. You can install it on your computer or use it online via Waves Central or StudioRack.
 
The Waves Puigchild 670 plugin is compatible with most DAWs and supports VST, AU and AAX formats. It also comes with presets from Jack Joseph Puig and other professional engineers to help you get started quickly. You can also tweak the settings to suit your own taste and style.

## How to Use the Waves Puigchild 670 Plugin on Vocals
 
One of the most common applications of the Waves Puigchild 670 plugin is on vocals. The plugin can help you smooth out vocal peaks, add some body and presence, and make the vocals sit better in the mix. Here are some tips on how to use the plugin on vocals:
 
- Start by setting the input level to match the level of your vocal track. You can use the headroom control to adjust the input level or use a gain plugin before the Puigchild 670.
- Choose the Lat/Vert mode if you want to compress the left and right channels equally or separately. Choose the M/S mode if you want to compress the mid and side signals differently or together.
- Set the threshold to a level where you see some gain reduction on the meter. The lower the threshold, the more compression you will apply.
- Set the time constant to one of the six presets: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Each preset has a different attack and release time that affects how fast and how long the compressor reacts to the signal. You can experiment with different presets to find the one that suits your vocal best.
- Set the output level to match the input level or slightly higher. You can use the makeup gain control to adjust the output level or use a gain plugin after the Puigchild 670.
- Use the mix knob to blend between the dry and wet signals. This allows you to do parallel compression, which means you can keep some of the original dynamics while adding some compression. A good starting point is around 50% mix.
- Use the sidechain filter to filter out low frequencies from triggering the compressor. This can help you avoid pumping effects and keep your low end intact. A good starting point is around 100 Hz.
- Use the noise control to add or remove analog noise from the plugin. This can help you emulate the sound of vintage hardware or keep your signal clean and digital. A good starting point is around -60 dB.

By using these settings, you should be able to achieve a smooth and warm vocal sound that blends well with your mix. You can also tweak them further to suit your taste and style.
