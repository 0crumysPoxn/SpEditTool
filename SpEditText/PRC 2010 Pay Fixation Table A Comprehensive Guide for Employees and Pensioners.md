The Revised Pay Scales 2010 (RPS 2010) were issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in February 2010, based on the recommendations of the Ninth Pay Revision Commission and the agreement with the Joint Action Committee of Employees, Teachers and Workers. The RPS 2010 came into effect from July 1, 2008, with monetary benefit from February 1, 2010. The arrears for February 2010 were credited to the GPF accounts of the employees, while the cash payment started from March 2010.

The RPS 2010 introduced a new master scale of Rs. 6700-200-7300-220-7960-240-8680-260-9460-280-10300-300-11200-330-12190-360-13270-390-14440-420-15700-450-17050-490-18520-530-20110-570-21820-610-23650-650-25600-700-27700-750-29950-800-32350-850-34900-900-37600-970-40510-1040-43630-1110-46960-1200-51760 1300 55600. It also gave a fitment benefit of 39% for fixing the pay in the revised scales, as against the 27% recommended by the commission.
 
The employees had to exercise their option either from July 1, 2008 or from the date on which they earned their next increment in the existing scale of pay before June 30, 2009. The option once exercised was final and had to be done within six months from the date of publication of the notification in AP Gazette. The employees who were under suspension, long leave or deputation had to exercise their option within one month from the date of joining duty.
 
The fixation of pay in the RPS 2010 involved the following steps:
 
1. Basic pay as on July 1, 2008 or next date of increment before June 30, 2009
2. DA as on July 1, 2008 (42.39%) on the basic pay
3. Fitment benefit (39%) on basic pay
4. Total emoluments
5. Pay fixed at next stage in RPS 2010

For example, if an employee had a basic pay of Rs. 7970 and a DA of Rs. 3378 as on July 1, 2008, his total emoluments would be Rs. (7970 + 3378 + (39% of 7970)) = Rs.14456. His pay would be fixed at Rs.14860 in RPS 2010.
 
The next increment would accrue on the normal date of the employee. If an employee had reached the maximum of the pre-revised scale and had exhausted all stagnation increments beyond the maximum of the scale and stagnated for less than one year as on July 1, 2008, he would get his next increment on completion of one year from that date. If he had stagnated for more than one year as on July 1, 2008, he would get his next increment on July 1, 2008 itself.
 
If the amount fixed under RPS 2010 was less than the minimum of the time scale, his pay would be fixed at the minimum of the time scale. If it was more than the maximum of the time scale attached to the post, his pay would be fixed at maximum of time scale and the difference would be shown as personal pay and absorbed in future increases.
 
A prc 2010 pay fixation table was provided by the government to help the employees calculate their revised pay and arrears. The table showed the existing pay scales, revised pay scales, fitment benefit and arrears for each stage of basic pay.[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
