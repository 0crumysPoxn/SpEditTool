The gameplay of Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D is similar to the original, but with some changes and additions. The player controls Terry as he explores various dungeons, battles monsters, and collects items and equipment. The dungeons are randomly generated and have different themes and layouts. The player can also use keys to access special dungeons with rare monsters and treasures.
 
The battles are turn-based and involve Terry and his team of up to four monsters against enemy monsters. The player can choose to command each monster individually, or let them act on their own based on their personality traits. The player can also use items and skills during battles, as well as swap monsters in and out of the team. The battles are affected by various factors, such as the terrain, the weather, and the time of day.
 
The main feature of the game is the monster breeding system, which allows the player to create new and stronger monsters by combining two existing ones. The resulting monster inherits traits, skills, and stats from its parents, as well as a new appearance and name. The player can also use special items to modify the breeding process and influence the outcome. The game features over 600 different monsters to breed and collect, including some from other Dragon Quest games and spin-offs.
