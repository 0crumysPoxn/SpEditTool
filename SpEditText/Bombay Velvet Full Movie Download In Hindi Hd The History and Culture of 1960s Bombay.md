The history and mission of TaizÃ©:
 
TaizÃ© is a small village in the Burgundy region of France, where a community of brothers from different Christian denominations live and pray together. The community was founded in 1940 by Brother Roger, a Swiss Protestant who wanted to create a place of reconciliation and peace in the midst of war and division. He was joined by other brothers from various countries and backgrounds, who shared his vision of ecumenism and simplicity.
 
The community soon became a place of pilgrimage for young people from all over the world, who came to experience the prayer and hospitality of TaizÃ©. The brothers also started to compose their own music, inspired by the traditions of the Eastern and Western churches, as well as by the cultures and languages of the people who visited them. The music of TaizÃ© is characterized by short and simple phrases, often taken from the Psalms or other biblical texts, that are sung repeatedly in a meditative way.
